# "Hello World" React Native Mobile App
To get started, make sure that you have Node JS installed and other dependencies that are listed if
"npx create-expo-app yourprojectname" leads to some errors(most likely if you are missing something besides Node JS it will provide you a list if what you may be missing). Then run the command "npx create-expo-app yourprojectname" after all dependencies have been satisfied.

## How to display your mobile app
Now you want to see your code in action. Download Expo Go, which should be available on IoS and Android, and open up the app. In the terminal(make sure you are in the folder of the project), go ahead and run "npx expo start". Your terminal should then start up the app project, providing you a QR code you can scan on your Expo Go app or a special link so that you can run your code on Expo Go.
