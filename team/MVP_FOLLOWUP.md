# MVP Followup
### Feedback Grouped and Sorted
- We got several pieces of feedback asking what differentiates BeeFree from the standard Apple Screentime app and other similar apps.
- We got a couple statements looking forward to what our sharing page might be able to do, and some suggestions about sharing functionality.
- We received several compliments regarding the UI and the polished look of the app.
- Multiple people commented that they want a system of reminders or notifications, and some also asked for higher customization capabilities
- Some people had quesstions about design and implementation choices, such as Google auth and entering a first name.

### Response Actions
- The main thing that will end up differentiating us is the sharing page, which we are working on. We will work on making this more obvious on our welcome page.
- We are in discussions about how we're going to implement the sharing page, including features like a leaderboard.
- We are looking into how we can send scheduled notifications to encourage productivity and progress.
- We are standing by our decision to have first-time users enter their first name, since we are aware that many potential users may have a different preferred name than the name associated with their email.

### Action Plan
Our focus pre-MVP was mainly on getting our login and app-blocking functionality to work, and work together. We finished that just in time for the MVP, so we will now shift our focus to getting the sharing and summary pages up.
This will help differentiate our app from other apps (Sharing), and also provide some of the summary statistics that our feedback givers were looking for.
One part of our team is focusing on adding friends, one part of our team is focusing on creating a summary pie-chart, and one part is focusing on quality-of-life improvements.
We hope with the feedback we were given, we can align our goals and create a product that our potential users will enjoy.
