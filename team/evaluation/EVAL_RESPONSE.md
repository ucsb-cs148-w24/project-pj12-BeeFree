## Response to: Provide feedback based on the team's USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md
Many of the team 1 participants felt that we could have provided more features to our app. One such feature was regarding a chat option between other users, which was something we did want to implement in the past, but might be too difficult to do right now. Another feature that participants requested was for more competitive features that would incentivize users to reach their screen time goals. This feature would be really great to add, but once again, might be tough due to our time constraint. However, a common feature many participants pointed out and we all feel is both doable and necessary is more functionality in our home page, which is blank at the moment. We got suggestions such as making the home page show what apps we have blocked which we do plan to try doing. 
Participants also provided comments on our color choices, and believe softer colors might be a better option to fit with the bee theme of the app. We agree with this criticism and will attempt to use softer colors to better match the color scheme of the rest of the app. 
For the most part, team 1 participants felt relatively good about the user exeperience, giving it about a 4/5 score. Participants did however, provide more comments regarding the UI/UX, but they were largely mentioned in a future question. 

## Response to: Please provide a summary of the features of the product as you understood them, and what you liked or thought could be improved about each
A lot of the responses here rolled over from the previous response, with many of the participants mentioning they liked how our app was able to block other apps easily. They once again mentioned how they would like to see more added to our home page and ways to interact with friends. One really interesting note that one of the participants mentioned was making the app work is a widget so users can easily have access to their app screentime summary as well as other people. We feel this would be a great idea to try implementing in the future, though would be challenging in our current time frame. 

## Response to: How intuitive was it to use the project? (Comment about the UI/UX design and robustness of the app)
As mentioned in the response to the first question, a common issue that participants mentioned was that our app was not clear on how users were to unblock apps. Currently, the only way to unblock apps is to use the "+" icon that is also used to block apps. This functionality is not very intuitive and was something participants pointed out needed to be explained by our team. We definitely agree with this assessment and will be making moves to ensure users can easily understand where and how they can unblock apps instead of having to use the same button that blocks apps. However, we do not want to make it too easy for the user, as we want to discourage them from unblocking apps unless they have reached their daily quota. 

## Response to: How was the deployment experience? Do you have comments about the other team's repo structure, README.md, or project Kanban board?  
Most participants felt satisfied with their deployment experiences and our documentation. One mentioned however, that Apple's link to explaining how to install and use Xcode was rather difficult to understand and would like us to try and explain more clearly how to do so, which we plan to do.
