# Testing Libraries
As we're using Swift in XCode, we don't have a lot of options as to what testing libraries we can use. From our research online and talking to instructors, we came to the conclusion that we would stick to using XCode's inbuilt XCTest framework. 

# Testing Approach
We're still exploring XCTest and it's capabilites, so for this week we really just wanted to get a basic test working. In order to accomplish this, we created a simple test that made sure the First Name that BeeFree users input is valid. We started with a simple math check of 5 == 5 to see if our test would run successfully, then once it did we adapted it to test the basic funcionality of name validity.  Validity is a simple check to make sure the first name does not include common curse words or other blacklisted words.
