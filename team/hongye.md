Our project name = "appblocker". 

A wonderful app that sets a timer for other apps to limit/block the usage. The app will have a group feature where you can form a group with your friends and see how much time they've spent and how much time they have left for the day.

This app allows you to make a group with your friends and can see how much time your friends are spending on their apps each day. Also it is possible to chat with them and send friendly reminders to their eyes if they are over using their phone.
