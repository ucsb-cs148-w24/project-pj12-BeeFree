Hello, I'm Karankumar Mageswaran! You can call me Karan. I'm a third year CS major. I love the idea of this project as it is something I can connect to and would be useful for my friends and I (we spend way too much time on our phones). Having an app that not only blocks apps, but also reports activity to a friend group where we not only have to hold ourselves accountable, but also our friends, which can create a healthy competition, and can make regular old App Blockers fun!
