# Our Experiments with AI

### Mujia
I used GitHub Copilot to help me write documentation for my select app page, making sure everything was correct and easy to understand. This tool was really helpful because it saved me time and made sure there's no syntax error. I had to carefully check everything Copilot suggested to make sure it was right. I found out that I could highlight the part of code and ask copilot what is it for clarity, which is also helpful in checking whether the output was correct.

I experimented with Gemini in order to attempt an app icon for BeeFree. I tried using prompts that described the function of the app as well as direcives for aesthetic, such as color choice, "cartoon style", or "cute". Unfortunately Gemini isn't very good at obeying the style guides I attempted to give it. It often gave very realistic, warped, and honestly kind of scary bee images. About 25% of the results I received were images I thought were usable. After a different teammate used Dall-E, I used Adobe's background remover in order to make a transparent background. I had to do some manual cropping and adjusting of the image to give the AI tool the highest chance of performing correctly, but it did work and was very useful for getting just the main subject of the app icon we wanted.

Utilizing Chat GPT, I was able to compare and contrast different unit testing frameworks and also analyze the role of AI in testing platforms. ChatGPT suggested out of all the options we discussed to use XCTest because it is already integrated into Xcode and was made for swift and object programs. I think we can consult chatGPT in future decisions when deliberating between different platforms and needing a voice that analyzes different perspectives.



### Mike
The AI tool I used was ChatGPT4. I asked gpt to generate bee themed app icon that also demonstrate blocking of some sort, and was able to get this result. Then Kavi was able to use online photo editing tools to make the icon fit our blue theme more. On top of this I also tried using GPT4 to make frontend changes, where I could upload a screenshot of our mockup and have it product some basic frontend code which I found pretty helpful.

### Karan
I used Gemini to create mockups for our summary page. I used prompts like "can you make a mock image that shows the dashboard for a screentime app?". I think this will be useful with giving us an idea of how to layout our summary page in an aesthetically pleasing way. 

### Peter
I utilize ChatGPT for working on FreeBee app, I find it tremendously efficient and educational. It helps me swiftly debug issues, generates suggestion design patterns, and guides me through creating the login in page and Firebase connections. This tool is invaluable for quickly resolving coding challenges, sparking new ideas, and advising on best practices. For effective use, I ensure to clearly articulate my coding problems, provide relevant context, and iteratively apply the solutions and insights I gain.

### Sunhu
I used Chat GPT to help understand SwiftUI components such as Vstack and Views more clearly now that we are getting into the heart of functionality programming. One of the functionalities I asked Chat GPT to help implement is user input request and storage, which we want to use for the sharing features of our app. I was able to learn more about @State variables which are used by SwiftUI, similar to React and React Native, in keeping track of changes made by users, particularly inputs. Unfortunately, Chat-GPT 3.5 is a little outdated with its understanding of SwiftUI, meaning I had to make adjustments, particularly with the preview function code, to ensure that it correctly works on new and updated Xcode and SwiftUI.
