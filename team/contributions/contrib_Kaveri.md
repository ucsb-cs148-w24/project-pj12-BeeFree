I think my contributions graph is not necessarily indicative of my actual contributions to the codebase. For some of my listed contributions, I was actually a reviewer, and not the person who made the code changes. This is shown in commits such as https://github.com/ucsb-cs148-w24/project-pj12-appblocker/commit/aac0a37bafe20796ad5386cf442d3bc562bdf395. My main tasks on the team was documenting meetings and leading the UX/UI decisions. Mujia and I worked together on the initial mockup, and I took over for the MVP as well as the User Flow. 
I consistently kept our figma mockup up to date, and created design guidelines through that. I also did quite a bit of pair programming with Anushka and Karan throughout the summary page development process. Thus I do not have many lines of code added in my name, though I do have several commits of sprint documentation updates. Furthermore, I worked on video recording and editing for the MVP and final presentation. Mike and I did quite a bit of pair programming with Mike in the last couple weeks as we were finalizing UI decisions and making all the pages standardized to our design guidelines. This code did not get its own separate commit and was locally combined into a different branch.
