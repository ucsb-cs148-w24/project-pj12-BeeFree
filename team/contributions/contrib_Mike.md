The contribution graph on the GitHub repo is not very accurate. GitHub gives the credit to the person who merges the changes rather than who writes and commits the code, so I think it's easier to ignore the graph and explain it here. For this project, I mainly worked on 4 different parts. First I helped everyone set up xcode and clone the github repo because the process is very different and a little confusing. Then I mainly worked on the login page. I first followed the firebase documentations to setup logging in with google authentication, then added the welcome page where the user can swipe up and access the login page. Then I focused on testing, and wrote unit tests and integration tests for the login features. Lastly my job is to make sure the UI is consistant across the whole app.
