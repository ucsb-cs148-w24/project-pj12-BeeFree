### Karankumar Mageswaran:
I worked on the code skeleton, which were mainly the tabs, title bar, and background colors for both the day and night modes of the app. 
I created the limit sheet view, the fuctionality that allows you to select and block apps, making it block with device activity monitor (beefree model and beefree schedule). The dark mode/light mode was buggy at first, but I managed to recently get it working again. Anushka and I worked alongside eachother to make the summary page show screentime with device activity report from Apple's ScreenTimeAPI. Currently, it shows the top 5 apps. I also added a function that allows users to select their screen time goals, which are then reflected on a pi chart that changes colors depending on how close the user is to passing their screen time limit. 

### Summary and Final Notes
Karan and Anushka largely worked on getting ScreenTimeAPI to work, while Mujia and Peter worked largely on Firebase storage for the app's sharing and friends functionality, while Mike and Kavi worked a lot on polishing the app to make it look as good as possible and as close to the app's initial mock up design as possible. Sunhu largely worked on documentation and presentation for the app. Everyone participated in pair programming, which may not be visible in the GitHubs contribution page.

The number of bullet points or lines above do not indicate everything regarding the amount of work everyone put in into this project. There were a lot of miscellaneous issues team members worked on that may not show up on the GitHub contributions graph. For example, Mujia provided us her office hours to help work together on the app every week after Friday 148 sections. Everyone put a lot of time and consistently came to meetings to help complete the app. We met every Saturday and Monday for 2 hours to help brainstorm and work on the app, and because of the commitment everyone provided, we were able to create BeeFree and have something as close to our initial goals as possible. 

I'd like to give a special congratulations to all teammates who worked on this project, everyone worked really hard and did everything to the best of their abilities!
