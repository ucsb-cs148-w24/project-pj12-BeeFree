Sunhu Choi: Currently, the contributions graph shows I have a lot of lines added and deleted but this is a little misleading, since a lot of my GitHub contributions came from 
documentation which inflated a lot of my numbers. As the only non-Apple user, I ended up doing a lot of documentation instead, but also did most of my programming via pair programming
While we were learning how to use Apple's ScreenTimeAPI, I worked alongside Anushka and helped do some coding on her laptop. While working with backend, I worked alongside Peter to
set up Firebase and Firestore which are being used for our login information currently. 

Kaveri Iyer: I think my contributions graph is not necessarily indicative of my actual contributions to the codebase. For some of my listed contributions, I was actually a reviewer, 
and not the person who made the code changes. This is shown in commits such as https://github.com/ucsb-cs148-w24/project-pj12-appblocker/commit/aac0a37bafe20796ad5386cf442d3bc562bdf395. 
My main tasks on the team was documenting meetings and leading the UX/UI decisions. Mujia and I worked together on the initial mockup, and I took over for the MVP as well as the User Flow. 
I consistently kept our figma mockup up to date, and created design guidelines through that. I also did quite a bit of pair programming with Anushka and Karan throughout the summary page 
development process. Thus I do not have many lines of code added in my name, though I do have several commits of sprint documentation updates.
