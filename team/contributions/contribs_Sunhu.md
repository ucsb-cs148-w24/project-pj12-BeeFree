My work mostly consisted of documentation that was required for this project. I helped lead retro 3, did the user manual, created the presentations for the app, and worked on the design and deployment docs. As the only non Apple user in the group, I was limited in the coding I had to do, being required to do most of my coding via pair programming. I helped set up the Firebase Cloud Firestore system we use in the app and did pair programming with Anushka and Peter to help work on ScreenTimeAPI and user inormation storage. My contributions graph on Github is a little bloated, most likely because the commits and deletions I made were from documentation rather than from code.
