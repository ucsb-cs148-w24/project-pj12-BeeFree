I think my contribution graph is not indicative for my actual contribution since I often work on a separate branch with Peter and he merge the changes when we are done. My main tasks on the team was implementing sharing feature and helping in making UX/UI decision. Kavi and I worked together on the initial mockup. Then Peter and I worked together on the sharing feature. I implement the SharingView page by add a time selection feature and a button that jumps to FriendView page. I wrote the skeleton code for FriendView page where users can see their friends' screen time. I also implement the AddFriendView page with Peter (I coded the skeleton file and he works on the backend stuff to finish this add friend feature). And I adjust the background colors and text color for these files to make UI consistent.
