I worked to set up firestore database to hold user's information and connect it to our app. Created a sign in page to guide new users to sign up with their username and store information in database, also making sure unique username for each user. Connect users to the content view after a successful login. Finished add friend page to allow users to add and remove other users as friends by searching up their emails in the database. Improved user experience by making add/remove friends appears in both user's end. Updated profile page by fetching user's name,email, and google profile imageto display in profile page. Added features to store user's screen time goal and actural screen time into the database for later use. Allow users to enter their screentime in sharing page and fetch all their friends' screentime data with a pie chart to better indicate their useage of the day.
