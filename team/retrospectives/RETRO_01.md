## Action Items:
* goal: no merge conflicts and no bugs post-merge by the next retro
* change: when you make a PR, write down what things you changed and what needs to be tested (dependencies)
* experiment: try commenting your progress as you work on PRs.

## Retro Assessment:
* We used the start/stop/continue method on a website called easyretro.io. I kept notes during the meeting on a Google Doc.
* The meeting went pretty well, everyone contributed to the cards in the retro. I think the discussions weren't as in-depth as they could have been, but that is partially due to the fact that it was our first retro and we're still in the baby steps of development. 
* I would recommend that the retro leader for next week think about probing and followup questions in order to encourage deeper discussions about the cards.

## Experiment/Change
* We did more thorough discussion regarding what changes were made to different features, and split branches by feature in order to localize frequent changes.
* We had no merge issues this week, thanks to increased PR descriptions, discussions, and testing criteria.
* We should keep these changes ,oving forward, and further concretize feature changes and testing criteria as they get more and more complicated.
