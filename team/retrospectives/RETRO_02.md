## Action Items:
* goal: Have better communication and finalize features. 
* change: Try to plan personal events around group meetings, communicate well with the team if you have to miss a meeting. 
* Communicate if and why you have to miss a meeting on the discord server at least 30 minutes before the meeting time. 

## Retro Assessment:
* We used the start/stop/continue method on a website called easyretro.io. I kept notes during the meeting on a Google Doc.
* I think we did a better job than the first retro. Everyone wrote at leaet one card for every column, and the top voted ones are very similar showing that we don't have many issues and we are all aware of them. 
* I would recommend that the retro leader for next week look back at the past 2 retros before leading the third one and see how we've changed and what still needs improvements.

## Experiment/Change
