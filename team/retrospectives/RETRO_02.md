# Date of Retrospective: 02/16/24

* Led by: Mike Wang
* Present: Anushka Vijay, Sunhu Choi, Peter Liang, Mujia Chen, Mike Wang, Karan Mageswaran, Kaveri Iyer
* Absent:

## Action Items:
* goal: Have better communication and finalize features. 
* change: Try to plan personal events around group meetings, and communicate well with the team if you have to miss a meeting. 
* Communicate if and why you have to miss a meeting on the discord server at least 30 minutes before the meeting time. 

## Retro Assessment:
* We used the start/stop/continue method on a website called easyretro.io. I kept notes during the meeting on a Google Doc.
* I think we did a better job than the first retro. Everyone wrote at least one card for every column, and the top-voted ones are very similar showing that we don't have many issues and we are all aware of them. 
* I would recommend that the retro leader for next week look back at the past 2 retros before leading the third one and see how we've changed and what still needs improvements.

## Experiment/Change
* Since the last retro, our whole team has been very good at communicating. When members had to miss a meeting due to midterms, we were able to communicate the night before the meeting so everyone commonly agreed on canceling the meeting and just doing some individual work.
* Nobody missed any meetings due to personal issues, and we only canceled a meeting when we needed to so people could study for midterms the next day.
