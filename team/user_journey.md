> Group of high school friends who spend too much time playing Genshin Impact, and want to challenge each other to spend less time playing video games:

This group of high school students did poorly on an exam and realized they need to cut back on video games in order to better prioritize their time. They have tried to limit their own screen time, but lacked the discipline, and they were often peer pressured into playing with each other. As a result, they looked into apps that can limit their screen time, and found our app; Our app not only provided a way to block apps, but also provided a group feature that fostered a healthy competition amongst the group of friends. They began to hold each other accountable and decreased their time gaming, freeing their schedules for more productive work!

> Single mother, Piera Jhon, working two jobs struggles to keep their children in check; needs an engaging way to control her children's screen time while away:

She realized that, while she was away, her children were spending too much time behind a screen rather than playing outside. She wanted a way to limit their screen time remotely, and found our app. She created a group with accounts for each of her children and was able to monitor her children's screen time with her account. The app subsequently blocked apps on the childrens' devices after a certain amount of time.
