I'm Mike Wang and I'm a 3rd year cs major. 

My idea is an app that blocks the usages of certain apps. The user can choose any app(s) and set a daily time limit for that app. When the time is up for the day, the app will block further usage of that app and sent notifications to user and the people in user's group to let everyone know. 

This brings up the group feature. The user can choose to join a group with friends, and everyone in the group will be able to see other people's usage of that app (How long they've been using it and how much time they have left for the day). If someone has been on their blocked app for a long time, the friends will get a notification and can choose to text the person to remind them to take a break.
