*Scribed Discussion*

We had a couple members out, but they communicated ahead of time.

Today's focus was going through our MVP feedback. We looked at what we thought the most important and common points were.

As part of the response to feedback, we discuss a notification system and decide to put more time towards our Sharing feature.
