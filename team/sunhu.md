# Hello, my name is Sunhu Choi!

## About me
Not sure what to put here, but I am an avid tennis fan who also loves to watch NBA basketball and plays games if the time permits. I also really
enjoy watching anime and have collected a lot of posters and figures of my favorite characters!

## Ideas for the project
I'm super excited to see what we can do with our App Blocker. I have many ideas including the use of FireBase to create accounts for people which 
can allow for interactability between different people to create a small social media-esque environment.
