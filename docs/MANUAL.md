# BeeFree
## Product Purpose
BeeFree's purpose is to provide those with phone addictions to easily keep track of their screentime usage and block applications they believe are distracting them the most.
Users don't have to fight their addictions alone but can share their progress and challenges with family and friends to continue to motivate them. It is a simple app that 
provides intuitive features so anyone can quickly download the app and get started on their new journey of being addiction-free.
## Intended User Audience
BeeFree is an app that is catered largely towards those with phone and screentime addictions, but is not limited to just these people. Anyone can use the app if they want to
keep track of their screentime information and/or want to share their information with others. Anyone who has a desire to keep themselves in check and want to improve 
their productivity by spending time off their phones are warmly welcome to try our app.
## Features
Our application has many features, but these are the main ones that we feel makes our application important and stand out 
### Accounts
Users can create new accounts and log into existing ones so they can store their information, which largely comes into play for our sharing and friends function
### App Blocking
One of the most important features of BeeFree. Users can select apps of certain categories, such as Games or Entertainment, to restrict from use. If the user tries to open the app,
they will see that the app is greyed out and a screen will open up to the user saying that the app is unable to be opened. Users can choose to unblock the app whenever they desire.
### Summary Page
Users can see their total activity report and the top 3 apps they have used the most. Users can use this information to determine what apps they should focus on for their addiction-
freeing journey.
### Sharing Page
A still work in progress feature, users can for now, manually search for emails that are registered with BeeFree and add them as a friend, which in the future, can see app screentime
data shared by the user in the future.
